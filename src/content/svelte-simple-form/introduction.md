A lightweight, **type-safe**, and **reactive** form state management hook for **Svelte 5**, featuring:

- Simply usage
- Zero dependencies
- Nested field paths support
- Dirty tracking, touched fields, and submission state
- Designed for **Svelte 5’s new reactive primitives**

### Installation

```bash
npm install svelte-simple-form
```

**Note:** This hook is built to work seamlessly with **Svelte 5's reactive system**, using `$state`, `$effect`, and `tick`. Make sure your project is on Svelte 5 or later.
